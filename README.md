## 💡 Examples

### Example 1: Beginner User
```
User: "I don't know much about cybersecurity, where do I start?"
Chatbot: I'd recommend starting with the basics! Try asking about:
• "What is a strong password?"
• "How do I avoid phishing scams?"
• "What is two-factor authentication?"

User: "What is a strong password?"
Chatbot: 🔒 Create strong passwords with at least 12 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information like birthdays or names.

💭 You might also ask: "Should I use a password manager?"
```

### Example 2: Worried User
```
User: "I'm really worried I might have clicked on a bad link"
Chatbot: I understand you're concerned about this. Let me help ease your worries with some practical advice:

🦠 If you suspect malware, run a full system scan immediately with updated antivirus software. Disconnect from the internet if you notice unusual behavior, and consider running a scan in safe mode.

💭 You might also ask: "What are the signs that my computer is infected?"
```

### Example 3: Advanced User with Memory
```
User: "Tell me more about network security"
Chatbot: As someone interested in network security, you might also want to know: 🔒 Secure your home Wi-Fi with WPA3 encryption (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn't available). Use a strong network password and change the default router login credentials.

💡 Since you're particularly interested in network security, I'd recommend diving deeper into advanced practices in this area.
